    <h2 class="centered">About the Data</h2>
    <p>
        The data on Bitcoin mining and energy consumption comes from the
        <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index">Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)</a>,
        which is a part of
        <a href="https://ccaf.io/">The Cambridge Centre for Alternitive Finance</a>
        at the University of Cambridge. Worldwide energy consumption and production data comes from the
        <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/electricity/electricity-consumption?pd=2&p=0000002&u=0&f=A&v=mapbubble&a=-&i=none&vo=value&&t=C&g=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001&l=249-ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvnvvvs0008&s=315532800000&e=1577836800000">
            U.S. Energy Information Administration.
        </a>
        Renewable energy data comes from the
        <a href="https://data.oecd.org/energy/renewable-energy.htm">
            OECD,
        </a>
        and the data on GDP per capita comes from
        <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">
            The World Bank.

        Due to the decentralized and unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies, the CBECI data
        features a number of underlying assumptions and limitations, including:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Geographical Accuracy:</strong>
                The only location indicator associated with the production of bitcoin is a
                computer's IP address. That said, cryptocurrency miners likely use VPNs and
                other network proxies to shield their actual location.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Electrical Consumption:</strong>
                Advances in the efficiency of computing technologies makes calculating the amount
                of energy used to calculate bitcoin a constantly evolving guessing game. Further,
                the efficiency and computing resources at any given mining center are unknown,
                requiring researchers to guess the average efficiency of a mining computer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mining's Carbon Footprint:</strong>
                Again due to the geographical uncertainty of most cryptocurrency mining, researchers
                also do not know what type of energy source powers a given mining center. Further,
                some centers may produce their own off-the-grid energy, a problem that also affects
                measuring renewable energy production in a given country. Therefore, it becomes
                difficult to measure the sustainability of cryptocurrency production.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vague Sample:</strong>
                The CBECI's bitcoin data "is based on an extrapolation of a sample of mining pool
                data." As a result, they acknowledge their sample may potentially be
                overrepresentative of mining centers from China. Further, they may not truly know
                how much of the whole their sample actually represents, complicating their
                calculations.
