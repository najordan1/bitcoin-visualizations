    <h2 class="centered">Our Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        First and most notably, 
        Bitcoin consumes a lot of energy&mdash;not as much as entire global industries, but that 
        the annual energy consumption of Bitcoin is now more than most countries should raise questions
        as to whether cryptocurrency technology is worth this much energy, and 
        where that energy is coming from. Indeed, only a small percentage of Bitcoin's energy comes from 
        renewable sources, and until China placed a ban on cryptocurrency mining the majority of it came 
        from coal. Despite the massive energy consumption, Bitcoin is also still a growing industry. Energy 
        consumption levels are rising even as a ban from China in July, who up until that point had been 
        by far the largest producer of Bitcoin in the world, severely impacted the amount of Bitcoin 
        mining operations. Bitcoin's current energy consumption has exceeded its pre-2021 levels, and it's 
        not likely to slow down without regulation or further restriction. At the same time, Bitcoin's 
        proof-of-work constancy means that the increased energy consumption isn't translating to an 
        increased production or value of Bitcoin, but instead to more redundant computations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arguably, Bitcoin is clearly consuming more energy (and non-renewable energy at that) 
        than it should be, and regulatory steps should be taken on a global level to halt the rise and 
        potentially even decrease the energy consumption of Bitcoin. If we were to expand this website with more 
        visualizations, we would want to look at the energy consumption of Bitcoin in terms of environmental impact, 
        comparisons between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (proof-of-stake model cryptocurrencies in particular), 
        forecasts for the future energy consumption of Bitcoin based on current data and trends, and if possible a 
        quantification of the touted benefits Bitcoin compared to other traditional currencies.
