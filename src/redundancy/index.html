    <h2 class="centered">Redundant Energy Consumption</h2>
    <p>As previously mentioned, one of the most fundamental parts of Bitcoin’s functionality is 
        its proof-of-work model, which it uses to maintain the security of its blockchain and 
        ensure a constant rate of production no matter how many mining computers are active. To 
        put it in basic terms, Bitcoin is mined through the generation of blocks, which requires 
        miners to find a hash below a target 256-bit number. Once found, a solution hash can be 
        easily verified by other miners, but the only way to find a solution is through an extraordinarily 
        high volume of guessing - the computational ‘work’ in question. Additionally, Bitcoin 
        adjusts the difficulty of this target based on the amount of miners in the network, so 
        that no matter how much computational power is used, a block will always be generated 
        approximately every 10 minutes. While this does ensure Bitcoin is consistently produced 
        and server-side fraud is prevented (as the low probability of finding a solution makes it 
        impossibly difficult for bad actors to extend fraudulent chains), it also means that all 
        Bitcoin miner are trying to solving the same problem at once, and thus a lot of the energy 
        consumption of bitcoin is largely spent on redundant work. To demonstrate this, the 
        following visualization has been created by taking the average daily total energy consumption 
        of Bitcoin in 2021 (as estimated by the CBECI) and dividing it by the energy consumption of a 
        single mining computer (5 kWh per hour, or 120 kWh when running continuously for a full day) 
        to find the average number of active Bitcoin mining computers on a given day. Each square 
        represents 144 computers: the red squares represent computers that solved a single block on 
        a given day, and the blue squares represent computers that worked continuously for 24 hours 
        without solving anything (and thus doing purely redundant work).</p>
    <svg id="chart"></svg>
    <p>As we can clearly see, even assuming the best case (and most likely, since the odds of solving 
        a block more than once in 24 hours is extremely low) scenario of every block being solved by 
        a different computer, the amount of computers doing purely redundant work on a given day outnumber 
        the rewarded computers by a ratio of 16,443:1. Additionally the 5 kWh figure is actually an 
        overestimation of the energy consumption of the average mining computer, meaning that the actual 
        number of computers mining Bitcoin, and thus the number of computers doing purely redundant work, 
        is likely even greater than this figure shows. One could argue that, since the proof-of-work model 
        maintains Bitcoin’s consistency and security, all of this computational power has a purpose and so, 
        the consumption, while redundant, is not wasted. However, this fails to consider whether Bitcoin is 
        the best use of the redundant computational power, particularly when more efficient models such as 
        proof-of-stake exist in other cryptocurrencies. This leads us to a question: if Bitcoin requires 
        this much redundant energy consumption to function (a number which will only increase as Bitcoin grows 
        and more computers join the network), then is Bitcoin really worth the energy it consumes?</p>
