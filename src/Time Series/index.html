    <h2>Bitcoin's Growing Energy Consumption</h2>
    <p>
      It's no secret that cryptocurrency technology has exploded in recent years;
      what was once seen as a niche and obtuse system now has Super Bowl ads
      comparing its impact on society to that of the wheel (and urging you to
      invest now for fear of missing out). Given how the environmental concerns
      and the energy cost of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been in discussion
      for some years now, it is worth examining if that leap in popularity has been
      met with a similar rise in energy consumption. How has the energy use of Bitcoin
      changed over time? Using a dataset of daily estimated energy use that goes back
      over a decade, we seek to answer this question.

      As we can clearly see from the line graph, Bitcoin's energy consumption has
      indeed exploded in the past few years, more than doubling its estimated daily
      consumption in 2018. This is concerning for a number of reasons, not the least
      of which are the environmental implications of this boom, considering that such
      cost was already
      <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/07/09/why-bitcoin-uses-so-much-energy">
        a huge point of concern and criticism in 2018
      </a>.
      Additionally, there seems to be no signs of this growth slowing down or stopping;
      the dent caused by the
      <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/01/04/crypto-banned-china-other-countries/">
        ban on cryptocurrency mining from China
      </a>
      (at the time the largest producer of Bitcoin consumption by far) in July 2021
      has already been made back and surpassed in less than six months. If the current
      lack of global regulation remains, the energy demand of Bitcoin will surely
      continue to grow, and its environmental impact alongside it.
